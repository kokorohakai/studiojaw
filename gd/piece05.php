<h2>Strategy:</h2>
<b>Purpose:</b><br>
This map was part of a larger project, but for the purpose
of this portfolio we shall focus on map itself.<br>
<br>
<b>Intended Audience:</b><br>
Kids to middle aged adults.<br>
<br>
<b>Intended Emotion:</b><br>
Fun and playful.<br>
<br>
<h2>Concept:</h2>
<b>Actual Emotion:</b><br>
Fun and exciting emotions were produced here by color,
perspective, and movement.<br>
<br>
<b>Line:</b><br>
The line of the artwork uses a lot of diagonals to make the
card more exciting to look at.<br>
<br>
<b>Perspective:</b><br>
The perspective used on the artwork was extremely close
up, again to create an exciting look and create unification
of the piece.<br>
<br>
<b>Fonts:</b><br>
For the addresses on the back, I needed something light and easy to read at a small size. Myriad Pro turned out to be the font that
worked best in this application. I also wanted it to look modern and clean, which was part of the decision to use that typeface.<br>
<br>
<b>Color:</b><br>
Since this is a Pac-Man™ themed map, the color palette was predetermined.<br>
<br>
<b>Other Design Choices:</b><br>
The idea was to make Downtown Kalamazoo appear to be a fun place. To most, playing video games is fun. I chose to make the
railroad tracks the way they are to make it look simplified like early video games, and I chose the font to play along with that same
idea. The style this map was done in is known as “bit-pop,” which is a trend reminiscent of an era of video games where simple
graphics required extra effort to represent an image. I made the dots the way they are to show major roads by emphasis through
transparency. None of the graphics overlap, because older games couldn’t do that so it wouldn’t make sense if I did. I feel this map
does a great job of making Downtown Kalamazoo look like a fun place to be.<br>
<br>
<h2>Research and Development:</h2>
I used an emulator to capture the color scheme of the game. I own an original Pac-Man™ game for the NES that I used for this
project. From there I recreated the lines and dots to look like Pac-Man™. Then, I added my own graphics in the same style as the
game as locations and markers on the map. The original map was from Google Maps™, which I then refashioned in this style. The
graphics and map were created in Illustrator.<br>
<br>
<h2>Execution:</h2>
I do not know what happened to the final piece. They were hung in a gallery and possibly distributed. However, the point of this
piece was to be something that can be printed and folded, then distributed at an event. I would assume they would be printed at
a Kinko’s with some form of glossy paper. This would probably cost $1.50 per plane, and I’d assume they’d only need 50 or so.
There are other methods of mass printing these cheaply, and they may even be able to get 50 done for about $25, depending on
how they were printed. The final plane does have a bleed to be cut down to.<br>
