<h1>The plan</h1><br><br>
The goal is to use crowd sourcing to get enough funding to host our first year. But before we can do that, certain things need to happen. We will need a staff, that is capable and organized. The staff unfortunately will need to volunteer their time.<br>
<br>


Let's look at the checklist of things we will need:<br>
<ul>
    <li>gather a staff of at least 6 dedicated people.</li>
    <li>a name</li>
    <li>a theme</li>
    <li>a mascot</li>
    <li>a location</li>
    <li>a budget (How much we'll need)</li>
</ul>
 
Then we can start a crowd sourcing campaign. Once we do, we need to work. And by that, I mean be assertive and advertise in any acceptable ways possible.
We will need to post on forums, 4chan, irc, facebook, etc. (Within tasteful and acceptable levels) about the convention.<br>
<br>
Let's start with these basics, then once we have begun crowd sourcing, we can focus on content. Obviously we have various panels we can do. I think we can expan upon the Touhou Freeplay / tournament AWA had. 
We have our, "Music Department" here in the midwest and we can handle a rave and also bring in some musical guests. 
I feel everyone from across the nation, and all regions of the U.S. should work together to have our first Touhou convention. We should work with current existing conventions, for guidance and help to make it happen.
