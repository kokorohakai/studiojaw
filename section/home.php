<h2>Hello,</h2>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
My name is Jo-Anna Wall, and welcome to my portfolio. I have worked in software for over 11 years now. I own a small company named Seijinohki PC Services 
and Software (say-gin-oh-key). I have also worked with other companies such as Diamond Phoenix and Eaton.<br>
<br>
I have had a prolong interest in User Interface Design and Web Design as far as I can remember. When I was in junior high school I started learning 
HTML from an O'Reily book I received while shadowing for a company called Netlink. This was also about the time I started to gain an interest in programming.
I taught myself TI-BASIC and made games for the TI-Calculators and sold them to other students. I then started to have an interest in graphics and video game development. I once even tried to make a game (an RPG) in QBASIC. One summer, I even attended a coding and robotics class, when my first completed game, "Box hunter" arose. I didn't have much skill then as I do now. During high school, I even passed an English class by instead of writing a 
report for our assigned reading, wrote a pong clone. My interest in Graphic Design comes from Highschool where I was the Layout and Design editor for 
our highschool newspaper Knightlife, where for over a year I was the Layout and Design Editor.<br>
<br>
During my years after high school, I have worked for many companies and coded in many languages. Under the Seijinohki name I have also worked on many independent products, such as <a href="http://yakko.cs.wmich.edu/~digiband">DigiBand</a> and <a href="http://www.withdint.com/">WithDint</a>, and worked under contract for many companies for either coding purposes or IT. I am a Software Engineer and Graphic Designer. I call myself an Engineer, because I create software from the ground up. Engineering how each class will function and interact with the rest of the application.
I am usually pretty capable at editing frameworks to improve functionality, or fix bugs.<br>
<br>
I had decided to go back to school to better train myself in Graphic Design, my goal is to apply the knowledge
I received from those courses to what I know about software, and further my career in User Interface Design. Companies I have worked for in the past, I 
was generally get put into tasks working on front-end development over back-end. I am capable of both, but most companies find my strengths in designing more
useful for front-end development.<br>
<br>
My mission in life is to be recognized for my work and to have a peace of mind. I hope to one day see one of my crazy ideas or products take shape and become the next big thing. I also wouldn't mind being part of helping someone else's idea take form and become big.<br><br>

I also am a DJ. I specialize in playing J-core, which can be define as, as far as I can tell, any Genre of Japanese E.D.M. (Electronic Dance Music) fused with Hardcore. Their 
styles range from club, pure techno, all the way up to Gabbar. I also do Karaoke, and I don't mind doing American stuff either. I also am trying to do a bit of production work as well.

<b style="color:red">New!</b>I have just released the source code of an inside project, used for various contracts and projects. It's called the Cirno Framework, please check it out <a href="?section=t&subsection=cirnoframework">here</a>!<br><br>
For an example of where all of my skills meet together in one project, click <a href="http://www.studiojaw.com/?section=dj&subsection=ps&file=papa_petes_-_whats_an_edm_~_comiket_style_%28C83%29.mp3&playgame=true">this</a>.
It is a fan based Touhou game I'm working on. You can see the Graphic Design I've done for the UI and artwork, my DJ skills in the music, and my coding skills in the multi-class Objected Oriented JS! :D It's a work in
progress, so you can watch it evolve as I am working on it. :3
<br><br>
Good News Everybody! If for some reason you were wondering how I've done some of the crazier things on this site, you can check out it's source code at Git Hub!
