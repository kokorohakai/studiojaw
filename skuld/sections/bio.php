I am a very different kind of person.  I am the type who can be very energetic or very apathetic about a situation. I aim
to make my point clear of whether I like/want to do something or not.  I am the type who likes for someone to get to the point and not
beat around the bush.  I try to be kind with everyone I meet, however; there are the individuals I don't like to be around.  I try to
show respect where I can and encourage/appreciate those around me.  I do not hate anyone in this world, but I do not wish to be around
those who simply aim to make the situation/problem worse.  I am a neutralist at heart, and very argumentive at times, however; I only
argue the opposing view, because I try to see the problem from a 3rd person.  This also could be said, that I do not like to take sides,
and yet try to find the best solution for the both.  This does apply to myself and my own personal problems.  Yes I battle with them
every day, and I may not be aware of some, but I do try for the best and I will lend an ear to any advice even if I may sound like I am
against it.

<b>Why I Chose Chibi Skuld:</b><br><img src="images/chibiskuld.png" align=right alt="chibiskuld">
My favorite anime is, "Ah! Megamisama" translated as, "Ah! My Goddess".  My favorite character from the series is Skuld, the youngest
sister of the 3 goddess' of the series.  She is a very intelligent, but very tempermental person.  She in some ways is a person I'd
like to be like, but in ways not.  She reminds me of who I am.  Now, I have no clue why I chose the chibi prefix.  The prefix means,
"little" literally.  So my nick translates as little skuld, but it's probably a reference to "Ah! My Mini Godess" which is a parity/spinoff
series of the AMG series.  AMMG is a series where the 3 goddess, 'chibify' to solve the problems of a rat who lives in the temple with
the goddess' in very episodic, episodes.  So there it is, I chose Chibi Skuld because I really like Skuld, most likely obsessed, however;
I don't care what people think about it.
