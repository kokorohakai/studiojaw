For the past year I've been working on Digiband. It's coming up soon the 1 year anniversary!!! This wil be on 10/25/06.
I hope to throw a party... but I might just wait that out until the wii launch party. :) As the many of you know that is
being released late November.  At the launch party for those who are extatic about DDR Supernova, we'll have DDR,
DrumMania, Guitar Freaks, and much more!  Please give me a call or e-mail if you are interested in attending.<br>
(Basically I'm looking at the 15th or the 16th of December, the day before I head out to visit my mom in oklahoma.)<br>

Unfortunately it's in japan only, maybe if we all bombard them with enough e-mails, they'll
do one here to!  Unfortunately that would require more legal US bemani machines.<br>
<br>
Possibly, Guitar Freaks V2 and Drum Mania V2 are going to be premiered there. However it is official that
BeatMania IIDX Happy Sky (12th mix) will be showcased at the bemani expo.<br>
We should all do our best to encourage Konami into bringing more of these games over at an affordable cost
for local arcades.<br>
release date: 09/02/2005<br>
<br>

Yay! more arm cramping! Gotta love it though!<br>
Looks like the GF/DM series will be following the V scheme of naming now, which is good.<br>
This avoids the previous issues where GF11 was DM10, etc.  So now arcade owners can get the
alignment correct of which machines link.<br>
<br>
<b><a href="http://www.konami.jp/am/bmIIDX12/">Beat Mania IIDX is realeased.</a></b>
Appearntly from what I could gather.. there will be 45 new songs, for a total of 350.<br>
This realeased is being named after the "Summer Sky" following the naming scheme of IIDX red.<br>
Should be a fun game to play, however no word on who in the US will have it.<br>

Slowly becoming the all purpose Rhythm game emulator.. however progress is going slow. (Probably because of "In the Groove".)<br>

A new and rising simulator.  Of course I wrote it! However we're not going to be just a simulator for much longer...<br>
