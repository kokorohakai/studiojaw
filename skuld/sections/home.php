<b>What This Page is About</b><br>
This site is mostly my experimental site.<br>
This is why I'm not supporting IE on this site, because IE sucks with CSS and transparent pngs.<br>
<br>
<b>Notice to All Browser Companies</b><br>
I originally was supporting IE7, however css support still lacks.  It works again now, but still has issues. (The background's not suppose to move.)
Don't you Other folks go wanging it over IE yet either, you still haven't fixed a few known bugs for years
such as the random disappearing right hand side of my mainscreen frame here, and mozilla has the little bug
that happens with the usage of the css property: "Position:fixed" and png layers, when I was using them on
my background(property: "z-index:##"). <br><br>
To know what the site is suppose to correctly look like, click <a href="images/correctlook.png">here</a><br>
<br>
Or futher more, the css3 properties I'd like to use that aren't even supported yet by any known browser.<br>
