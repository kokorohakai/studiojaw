<center><b>Web Site Design/Developemnt</b><br></center>
<hr>
Besides this obviously experimental site, I create many websites. However, all other sites I create conform to render correctly under IE 6 and Mozilla based browsers.  This is the only exception of the rule.<br>
<br>
When I create websites, I usually hand code all elements of the site using HTML 4.1 transitional standards, and using Active Server Pages (not asp.net).  I am yet to learn ASP.net.
However the Computer Club site, (yakko.cs.wmich.edu) I maintain uses php and HTML 4.1 transitional. I've been kinda lazy getting it validated since the site renders fine, and is quite large.
This site as well uses PHP for it's server side scripting since it is hosted on yakko.<br>

<b>Computer Club of Western Michigan University, (2005)(almost complete)</b></a><br></center>
In summer of 2005, I was elected Secretary and Webmaster of CCoWMU.  My task was to reface this website, and forcibly learn php,
In the end I created this site slightly designed similar to the Guardians of the Realm site.<br>
This site 50% validates to W3C at the moment because I have been to lazy to finish the task, but I have met my declaration to have a new
look for the site that renders correctly in all browsers by Fall 2005.  I will once the Fall semester begins at WMU, continue to move
my efforts to make the site W3C standardized.

<b>Guardians of the Realm, World of Warcraft Guild, (2005)(complete)</b></a><br></center>
This is a website design in ASP and is one of the most elaborate sites I've created using scripts from many of may ASP websites that
I have created in the past.  It features an ASP based web forum, with very diffent, flavorful CSS elements.  With help with the art by
TheGreatOni, this became also one of the best looking sites I have created.<br>

<b>NESter Radio, Internet Radio Station(2005)(complete?)</b></a></center>
Originally started as it is now.  However, It once featured lots of cool ASP features, where users could manipulate a winamp playlist by selecting from
an asp generated file browser, mp3s they chose to listen too.  A user would select an mp3, and it was enque'd to the playlist. This was
possible by using, manipulating and parsing a web interface that controlled winamp through a web browser, and by using special VB
dll's for executing applications on the web server.  However, we (Seijinohki.net and assoc.) had issues with the site not reading certain files, and becoming
sluggish.  We wish we could have kept the site up and running, but had too many bugs, we have been looking for new solutions to this,
since now the media server NESter runs on linux.<br>
The source for the website is available on request.<br>

<b style="color:red">MP3 DISCLAIMER</b><br>
I had received the mp3's I own before the RIAA, and before the RIAA's initiative to stop Napster and other p2p applications.<br>
Most of them ARE LEGAL.  However there are select MP3's that are not, I am not sure which ones these are, but I refuse to delete all
of my MP3's because of a few bad apples.  And due to the FCC's laws on Broadcasting, Internet broadcasting does not fall in radio
brodcasting; thus, legal.<br>

<b>Computer Advisory Group(2004)(No longer maintained by me)</b></a></center>
The site still hasn't changed from what I updated it too. However me and the owner of this company didn't quite see eye to eye on many
things, so I completed this site before I left the company.  What happens to it will happen, however the source of the version I created
I will retain in the case that this website changes.<br>

<b>Seijinohki PC Services(1998)(2002)</b></a></center>
Originally started as a site like this.  It was a private site for my art work and projects, however; since 2002 we have been in operation
as Seijinohki PC services and have offered services for web developement/design and general maintenance/repair.  The original site was
quite atrocious, as at the time my web design skills weren't on par with today's standards.  Back then I wasn't even using pure HTML, I
was creating documents in word and exporting them.  However due to realizing what I learned in high-school Journalism, I changed my
design of the site to fit a more suitable look.  It wasn't til' about 2003 that the whole marmot thing started as well.  For more info
on that, read the about section of the page.<br>

original site location: http://www.fixyourskirtalice.org/<br></b>
This site became insanely popular, before its dismissal in 2005. The site had over 100,000 hits and had a daily traffic of 40 new users a day
as well as 300 visitors per day.  This site however was an adult only site, that for moral reasons I had to take down.  I wrote the code
and operated the site, however didn't supply the images.  The images were supply by numerous people that uploaded them their selfs, or
donated in archives to be uploaded.  However, due to lack of future funding, in support. As well as the defammation the site was causing
to my name, I had to down the site.<br>
<br>
If someone is interested in bringing the site back, they are more than welcome to the source code of the site. However I will not allow
the person to use it for profit or gain, and may not be called "FixYourSkirtAlice".<br>
<br>
The trick and story behind the site was originally a discussion between friends about creating a self sufficient free image site (FYSA
wasn't intended for just hentai/porn) that would become really popular than charge advertisers larger than normal amounts to advertise
on the site.  The site was written in 3 days, and posted up as http://fysa.seijinohki.net/.  Shortly after it started becoming the
hentai site it was known for, and thus reposted to the domain http://www.fixyourskirtalice.org/ to avoid professional conflict.
However prospective employers still located the site, so I had to in the end shut it down.<br>
<br>
I apologize to fans of the site, and I can name a few regulars. It's just that it's hard to have fun and remain professional at the
same time.<br>
<br>
However check this site out if you REALLY miss a site like FYSA.<br>

<b>Warcraft III fansite (2004)(discontinued)<br>
Original location: http://warcraftiii.seijinohki.net/</b><br>
I could easily bring this site back, but there was no interest in it, so it remains dead.  The source is available however.  This site
was created based on code from FixYourSkirtAlice and was created to pizaz blizzard in hiring me for a job... and I was unsuccessful.
Granted, I was 1 out of probably thousands who applied.<br>
I have decided to take what I have experienced as a learning lesson, Thus nothing else much to say about this site, except that it was
a forum with theming, just like FYSA.<br>

<b>Beer voting site, hosted on the computer, "beercan".(2003)(discontinued)<br>
Original location: http://beercan.seijinohki.net/</b><br>
after refacing Seijinohki.Net I thought I'd play with something and experiment with asp.<br>
This I created a beer uploading/voting forum.  This is the craziness that spawned FYSA.  It wasn't nearly popular however was still
a fun little site, and I've been wanting to bring it back but just haven't really cared to.<br>

<b>Mayhem no baka (2001)(mediocre)<br>
Original location: http://mayhemnobaka.seijinohki.net</b><br>
It was moderately popular, however I just didn't have the patience for doing it.  It's basically a very simply site that was for
a web comic I did that incorporated hand draw art of a photo scenery that took place mostly on the WMU campus.<br>
I finished maybe 4 comics, before I kinda gave up drawing it.  I may or may not work on it in the future.<br>
