<b>The History of JAFAX - Japanese Art, Film and Animation eXpo.</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gentleman named Rob Grimes, having watched Japanese animation since his childhood, started JAFAX (pronounced jay-fax) in 1995. His goal was to share his love of anime with others in the West Michigan area.  By using a college campus, he found a way to achieve his goal without having to charge any entrance or "membership" fees.  The first year, the event was basically a day-long screening session, but it allowed nearly 150 local anime fans to network and realize that such an evernt was possible in this area.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second year of JAFAX marked the first time there was a dedicated vendor area,  mostly featuring local comic and anime shops. In keeping with the free aspect of the event, the vendors were given space at no charge.  That year JAFAX had 300 attendees.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The event had to move to a larger college campus for JAFAX 3.  While it was sad to leave the old venue, the new location made it possible to show more anime than ever, and has allowed the event to continue expanding to this day.  With the new location came larger rooms, which we took advantage of by showing US premiers of upcoming domestic anime releases; that year it was Golgo 13: Queen Bee.  It was also the first year we had a guest, in the form of Robert DeJesus.  Robert could not make it to JAFAX 4 due to a scheduling conflict, but has been coming back ever since then.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For JAFAX 4, we added a music video contest, a video game room, and a game show.  We have been adding more game shows and different contests every year.  Our big premier for the year was a special version of the first episode of Cowboy Bebop.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A campus organization dealing with Role Playing Games joined up with us for JAFAX 5 to further expand the horizons of the event beyond animation.  Prior to that, small gaming sessions had been hosted by staff volunteers.  Aside from the triumphant return of Robert DeJesus, this year marked the first appearance of James Dawsey at JAFAX.  James has also been returning every year since.  Unfortunately, Rob had to step down as one of the primary organizers of the even, but many capable hands took over for him.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At JAFAX 6, we held our first costume contest, which was long overdue and well attended.  We were also proud to present Steve Bennett and Doug Smith from Studio Ironcat as the event's newest guests.  With Steve as a guest, we presented his famous cel painting course, as well as a "How to Draw Manga" class hosted by him and Robert.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The JAFAX 7 guest list expanded to include not only those mentioned previously, but also Amy Howard-Wilson.  Amy and Doug did a wonderful voice acting panel, and Doug's fiancee, Nickey, and the "Not Ready for Bandai Players", a costume group, did a costuming workshop, which was very well received.  Due to the number of panels that were held, we created a dedicated panel room, instead of holding them in a screening room as we had in the past.  This freed up the screening rooms for more game shows, and premiers including, "Evangelion: Death & Rebirth", "End of Evangelion", and "Escaflowne: the Movie". We also added a martial arts demonstration from a local dojo, and an official artist's alley area.  With all of these improvements, JAFAX 7 reached a grand total of 1300 attendees for the weekend, becoming the first year to hve over a thousand attendees.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For JAFAX 8, the effort to expand a little every year continued with the addition of guests Jan Scott Frazier, Bruce Lewis, and Newton Ewell. This prompted us to add a second panel room.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JAFAX 9 branched out further, with the event adding screening rooms in Manitou Hall. Nickey was able to return to the event along with all of the other regular guests, and we added voice actor Michael Coleman to our list of guests, making him our first international guest. Attendance reached 2100, blowing away our most optimistic estimates. JAFAX 9 was the first year we had a theme; "Anime Luau"<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JAFAX 10 was a milestone in many ways. For a decade, we were still going, and we were still free for the attendees.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JAFAX 11 added our second international guest, Trevor Devall and also added a third panel room to our ever growing event.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At JAFAX 12, it was our 10th year here at Grand Valley State University, we continued to grow and improve the event. The theme for that year, since it was JAFAX 12, the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac. Due to our ever expanding event, this was the first year we experimented with charging vendors for space.  Needless to say the vendors gladly contributed and quality improved vastly.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we saw it was our 13th year, we had no choice but to use the theme, "JAFAX the Thirteenth: Night of the Living Otaku".  Focused around horror, we are experimenting with the expansion to four buildings!  We are still motivated by Rob's initial dream of introducing the general public to Japanese animation, while educating them on some aspects of culture, and are proud to continue its history of being a free event.  We have a lot more excitement planned for JAFAX 14, and look forward to seeing more people attend than ever before!<br><br>
