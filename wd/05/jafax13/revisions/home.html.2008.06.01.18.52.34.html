<b>Greetings Everyone</b><br>
     Welcome to the JAFAX 13 website!<br>
<br>
     This year's theme is Horror!!! oooooo spooooooky! We have an amazing event 
planned for you this year.  If you don't know by now, JAFAX is the nation's largest free 
anime convention.  It is specifically focused in educating its attendees in all aspects of Japanese 
culture.  It's a two day festival with games, contests, entertainment, education and shopping.  
Each year, guests join us from different parts of the Anime and Japanese cultural industry to
bring this event to you.  JAFAX also exists to support rising artists, giving them an outlet
to express themselves to you and our guests.  Don't forget to pick up some Pocky from one of 
our many vendors!<br>
<br>
     This year marks our 13th year, and we are still going strong!  Unlike other conventions, getting 
into Jafax is fast and easy!  Just come in through the front door, sign your name, and get your
bag!  How do we get away with it you ask?  Well Jafax receives donations from
various resources including GVSU and GRCC.  Vendors graciously pay our reasonable fees for space and artists willingly contribute a piece of their work.
But this is also where we need you! Without you, these contributions would not be possible.<br>
<br>
So come and join us, it's free!<br>
