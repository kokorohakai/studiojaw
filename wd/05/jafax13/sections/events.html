</div>
<br>
<b>Content Guidelines</b><br>
<div style="padding-left:20px;">
AMVs should meet the following guidelines:<br>
<br>
- The AMV must be at least 30 seconds and no more than 6 minutes long.<br>
- At least 66% of the video must be Japanese animation and/or Japanese video game footage.<br>

- No logos, watermarks, or other similar artifacts may be present on the source footage.<br>
- No subtitles may be present on the source footage. Subtitles added by the creator are permitted.<br>
- Credits, bumpers, title screens, watermarks, and other such forms of identification are not allowed. Uniform title cards will be created using the information provided on the Entry Form.<br>
- The AMV must be of sufficient audio and video quality for a theater-type presentation.<br>
- The AMV must not exceed PG-13 content standards as defined by the MPAA.<br>
<br>
Exceptions to these rules will be made on a case by case basis at the discretion of the Contest Coordinator. If you aren't sure if your video will be accepted, email the Contest Coordinator at amv@jafax.org.<br>
<br>
</div>
<b>Submission Rules</b><br>
<br>
General<br>
<div style="padding-left:20px;">
- AMVs with multiple creators may be submitted, but JAFAX does not guarantee that more than one prize will be awarded per video.<br>
<br>
- Creators may submit up to three AMVs. If multiple AMVs from the same creator are placed into the same category, the creator will choose one video to compete, and the rest will be removed from the contest. Participation in a multiple-creator AMV counts toward both of these limits.<br>
<br>
- AMVs must have been completed on or after January 1, 2006, and may not have competed in any previous JAFAX AMV Contest.<br>
<br>
- AMVs that have won more than three major awards from any AMV contest are not eligible to participate. Major awards include but are not limited to Best of Show, Best of Category, Best Technical, and Audience Choice. Any number of other awards, such as Honorable Mention, Runner Up, etc. are permitted.<br>
<br>
- AMVs (with Entry Forms) must be received by May 31st, 2008, 11:59pm.<br>
<br>
- AMVs must be original compositions by the individual(s) submitting the AMVs. Submitting another creator's AMV as one's own work or incorporating part or whole of another creator's AMV into a separate AMV without express written consent from the original creator will result in immediate, permanent, and perpetual disqualification from the current and all future JAFAX AMV Contests. However, parody or satire of another creator's video may be permitted on a case-by-case basis.<br>
</div>
<br>
Technical Specifications<br>
<div style="padding-left:20px;">
Submitted files must meet the following specifications:<br>
<br>
- Video Format: MPEG-2, MPEG-4, or DivX/XviD<br>
- Framerate: 30 frames per second maximum, progressive only (no interlaced video)<br>
- Resolution: 480 pixels maximum vertical, no maximum horizontal<br>
- Pixel Aspect Ratio: 1:1 (square)<br>
- Audio Format: Uncompressed PCM, MP3, or MP4 (16 bit stereo)<br>
- Audio Sample Rate: 44.1 kHz or 48 kHz<br>
- Container Type: MPEG, MP4, AVI<br>
- Video and audio should be encoded for maximum quality (without going overboard and causing decoding problems, of course). As a guideline, we suggest encoding MPEG-2 video at a bit-rate between 2 Mbps and 5 Mbps, and MP3 audio at 256 kbps or higher. Variable bitrate encoding is fine.<br>
- Do not use joint stereo for your audio encode. This will create noticeable audio artifacts, and your video may be disqualified.<br>
- Should include 2 seconds of black silence before and after your AMV. This does not count toward the time limit.<br>
</div>
Media<br>
<div style="padding-left:20px;">
AMVs will be accepted on CD-R, DVD-R, or DVD+R discs only. AMVs must be burned as a file (a data disc), not as an authored VCD or DVD (a video disc).<br>
<br>
All media become the property of JAFAX upon submission and will not be returned. Do not send your only copy!<br>
