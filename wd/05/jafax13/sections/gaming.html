<b>Video Gaming</b><br>
Featuring 8 tournaments each year as of JAFAX 13, the video game room will keep you entertained for hours. Careful, it's easy to get distracted from the rest of the con once you walk into this room. But please remember to follow the rules! Those are as follows:<br><br>
1. Game Room staff cannot and will not attend in any of the tournaments.<br>
2. Other Jafax staff and Volunteers (including game room volunteers) can attend in any tournament as they will not know anything more than you will until the day of the event.<br>
3. There will be a cap on each tournament, once the cap is met, registration will be closed, and a fill in list will be started.<br>
4. After round 1, no one new, including fill ins, will be allowed registration.<br>
5. No personal Controllers, software, or hardware unless the tournament specific requires it. If you bring them you will be asked to take them out of the room, with the only exception being staff and game room volunteers.<br>
6. No heckling, If you are there to just complain, you will be asked to leave.<br>
7. Take turns when not playing in tournaments, if you hog a console, you will be asked to share, if repeated requests are made, we will ask you to leave.<br>
8. No custom options or controls unless the tournament specifies otherwise are allowed, use of will disqualify you from the tournament.<br>
9. Do not stand in aisles, we have plenty of seating this year, if you have to please stand in the back.<br>
10. You must be present when you are called for a tournament, if 30 seconds pass with no answer, you will be disqualified, and if applicable a fill in will take your place.  The tournament schedule without game times is below, you know the times now, no excuses.<br>
<br>
The necessary specifics:<br>
There will be DDR and Pump It up. This will located in a different location than the game room proper, usually outdoors.<br>
Please, as always, bring appropriate gear to play outside if attending.  We shall try to provide moderate cooling for those while playing.  <br>
<br>
volunteering for the game room:<br>
There is no special rule for game room volunteers, simply follow the procedure for volunteering for JAFAX, however be SPECIFIC and state that you want to volunteer for the game room.  Once you have done this, our Game Room Coordinator will contact you as necessary or as requested.<br>

<b>Table Top Gaming</b><br>
There will be table top gaming this year.  For those who knew where the video game room was last at JAFAX, it's that room. For those who don't know where that is, it's on the 2nd floor of padnos on the north end of the building.  When we have more information about what games will be ran, we will inform you.
