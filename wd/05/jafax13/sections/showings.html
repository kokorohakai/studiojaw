<b>Anime Showings at JAFAX</b><br>
Tired from all the running around, getting autographs, checking out artwork and shopping?  Stop by one of our many showing rooms and take the load off for a while!  We have many different showing rooms including:<br><br>
- Subtitled: For those of you who like a little light reading with your anime, this room features only subtitled anime.<br>
- Dubbed: If you just want to watch your anime, this room features only dubbed anime.<br>
- Family-Friendly: Just because itÅ's listed as Å"kid-friendlyÅ" doesnÅ't mean adults canÅft enjoy it too. <br>
- Adult-Friendly: This room will feature anime that is best suited for a more mature audience. These titles have been labeled Å"matureÅ" because they contain violence, sexual situations, and/or offensive languages. This room is constantly monitored to ensure that no one under 18 enters it. No ID, no entrance, NO EXCEPTIONS!<br>
- Live-Action: This room will show non-animated features for your viewing pleasure! <br>
- Series: These rooms are a crash course in the diversity and breath available in the genres of anime, with no more than the first DVD of any series being shown.<br>
- Classics: Sunday only room will show anime that was produced before 1992, for the fan of Ågold schoolÅh anime.<br>
- Staff Favorites: We love anime too, so to show it, we have decided to create the staff favorites.  Come watch what we ourselves hand picked as our favorite anime!
