<b>Greetings Everyone</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to the Jafax XIV website!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This years theme is Rock and Roll!!! So make some noise! We have an amazing event 
planned for you this year.  If you don't know by now, JAFAX is the nations largest free 
anime convention.  Specifically focused in educating it's attendees in all aspects of Japanese 
culture.  It's a two day festival with games, contests, entertainment, education and shopping.  
Each year, guests join us from different parts of the Anime and Japanese cultural industry, to
bring this event to you.  Jafax also exists to support uprising artists, giving them an outlet
to express themselves to you and our guests.  Don't forget to pick up some pocky from one of 
our many vendors!<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year marks our 14th year, and we are still going strong!  Unlike other conventions, getting 
into jafax is fast and easy!  Just come in through the front door, sign your name, and get your
bag!  How do we get away with it you ask?  Well Jafax receives donations from
various resources including GVSU and GRCC.  Vendors gratiously pay our reasonable fees for space and artists willingly contribute a peice of their work.
But this is also where we need you! Without you, these contributions would not be possible.<br>
<br>
So come and join us, it's free!<br>
