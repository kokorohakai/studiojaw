  <li>This is a craftsmanship       contest. No completely store-bought costumes, commissioned costumes, or       costumes made by friend, family member etc. We reserve the right to turn       down entrants based on how much of the costume is constructed by them. However,       use of a &ldquo;model&rdquo; is permitted if the creator desires not to show the       costume on themselves. The award will be given to the creator.</li>
  <li>Groups will <u>not</u> be limited, but we       reserve the right to change this rule if circumstances call for it. A       group counts as one entrance. Only one award will be given to the group. The       whole group must appear for pre-judging and registration or the group will       be disqualified. </li>
