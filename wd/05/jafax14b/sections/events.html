<h1>Events</h1>
<p>We've got a great lineup of programming and activities this year. Of course, the focus of JAFAX is always the screening rooms, and this year we needed three buildings to fit them all. A detail programming schedule will be published in the program. As always, there will be a family-friendly room for the kids, and anything rated higher than &quot;R&quot; goes in the adults-only room (Nobody under 18, we check IDs). You'll see the usual array of showing rooms, although this year we're introducing some new ones, including the Theme Room and the Staff Picks room. </p>
<p>Our special guests will be doing several panels, the panel schedule will be in the program. </p>
<p>There will be a number of contests at JAFAX, detailed on the <a href="?section=contests">contests page</a>.</p>
<p>There will be gaming (tabletop games and videogames) at JAFAX as usual, detailed on the <a href="?section=gaming">gaming page</a>.</p>
