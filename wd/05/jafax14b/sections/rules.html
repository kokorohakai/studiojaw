<h1>General Rules for JAFAX Attendees</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Parents, you are responsible for your kids! The family-friendly room is full of programming just for them, but <strong>it is not a daycare</strong>. </li>
  <li>Weapons must be left in your vehicle. This includes any props that can be used as a weapon at the discretion of JAFAX staff. Due to being held on a University campus, we are bound by a pretty strict weapons policy, there are a lot of props that you could carry around at other conventions that you can not carry around here. Weapons include:
    <ol>
      <li>Anything sharp and over 3 inches long</li>
      <li>Anything that could be used as a club; solid objects over a foot long</li>
      <li>Loose chain over a foot long</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li> No shirt, no shoes, no entrance!</li>
  <li> Be courteous!  Don't do anything to someone else that you wouldn't want done to you.</li>
  <li><strong> No solicitiation signs</strong>. This includes any signs offering physical contact or anything asking for money.  This does not include signs that are part of a costume. </li>
</ol>
