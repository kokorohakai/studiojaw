<h1>Vendors' information</h1>
<p>Thank you for your interest in becoming a JAFAX vendor!</p>
<h2>How to become a vendor</h2>
<p>E-mail <a href="mailto:vendors@jafax.org">vendors@jafax.org</a>.  Table space is plentiful but finite, we do sometimes have to turn away vendors if we are full.  Vendors are mostly accepted on a first-come, first served basis, though we do reserve the right to select vendors who bring something particularly unique to the event.</p>
