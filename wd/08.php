<h1>Web Design at Premier Products</h1><br><br>
I'm very sorry to say, I do not have any screenshots of the work I performed at Premier Products. When I worked at Premier, I was the IT manager. I managed their QAD server, file server, mail server, Video Security System, and Asterisk PBX.<br>
<br>
The QAD server ran IIS and used a special method of authenticating that I had wrote myself. It avoided repeat attacks and had other security features. This was so it could be access remotely for checking e-mail,
orders, and general server monitoring and statistics. It was tied into the PBX system to call management when a problem was occuring with the QAD server and preventing orders from being processed. The alert system
for breaks and alarms was also handled through the PBX system.<br>
<br>
The PBX system was designed with asterisk. It used special scripts and modifications to handle music on hold, call forwarding, a PA system, call meeting/waiting, and conferencing. This ran on a gentoo linux based
server. The intranet site designed for this pbx allowed checking voicemails, checking lines, remote asterisk configuring, and much more.<br>
